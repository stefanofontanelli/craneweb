Overview
--------

craneweb is an up-to-date micro web framework for C, which tries to reproduce
the look and feel of the modern web frameworks. craneweb is licensed under the
terms of the ZLIB license.

craneweb tries heavy inspiration from the following frameworks:

* [Raphters](https://github.com/DanielWaterworth/Raphters)
* [bottle](https://github.com/defnull/bottle)

The objectives for craneweb are:

* ease of embeddability.
* compactness: the bloat should be trimmed as most as is possible.
* zero-external dependencies: any external dependency is bundled with craneweb.
  Of course all licenses are compatible (and BSD-like). 
* simplicity: the code should be easy to read, easy to maintain and
  easy to keep in mind.


Requirements/Dependencies (common)
----------------------------------

* C89 compiler (tested against gcc 4+).
* [cmake](http://www.cmake.org)


Bundled dependencies (software craneweb relies on)
------------------------------------------------

* [http-parser](https://github.com/ry/http-parser)
* [ngtemplate](https://github.com/breckinloggins/ngtemplate)
* [Spencer's regex](http://www.arglist.com/regex)
* [mongoose](http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)
